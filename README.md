# 2D_Self-driving_Simulation-DQN
Implemented Deep Q-Network (DQN) with greedy action selection policy for simulating a self-driving vehicle using OpenAI Gym car racing environment and CNN architecture.

- Please refer to the DQN Project Paper [link](https://github.com/Ghani-Haider/2D_Self-driving_Simulation-DQN/blob/main/DQN%20Project%20Paper.pdf) for problem understanding, implementation and results.
